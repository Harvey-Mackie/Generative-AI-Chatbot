# Affective Virtual Agent 

Note - this was created as my final year project at University while studying Comp Sci. 

The paper title is 'An Investigation into the effectiveness of emotionally intelligent virtual agentsâ€™ ability to showcase empathy for users' - please contact if interested in reading.

## Overview
A conversational agent that utilizes sentiment analysis and facial emotion recognition to provide empathetic responses. Built using Python, Flask, and TensorLayer.

## Features
- Seq2Seq model for open domain conversations
- Multiple agent personalities with varying levels of emotional intelligence
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Real-time facial emotion recognition using Affectiva SDK
- Web-based interface for interaction

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask
- ML Framework: TensorLayer (based on TensorFlow)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
- Emotion Recognition: Affectiva Emotion Detection SDK
- Testing: Pytest (backend), Jasmine (frontend)

## Chatbot Model Details
- Architecture: Seq2Seq model with 3 RNN layers
- Training Data:
  - Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus (220,579 dialogs)
  - Twitter Corpus (377,265 conversations)
- Layer Configuration: 256 units per layer
- Training Split: 70% training, 15% testing, 15% validation

## Virtual Agent Personalities
- Base Agent: No affective computing
- Sentiment-Aware Agent: Utilizes sentiment analysis
- Emotionally-Aware Agent: Utilizes both sentiment analysis and facial emotion recognition

## Getting Started

- To set-up the environment for the application, ensure you have Python 3.5> installed on your machine.
- Once installed, run the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Access the config.py file in the directory root, here, alter the variable `packageDir` to the full path of the root directory (Virtual Agent)
- Open terminal/command prompt on your machine (navigate to Virtual Agent Directory), and enter the following command `py main.py` or `python main.py`, to initialise the FLASK application.
- Naviagate to the URL outined in the terminal - e.g. **127.0.0.1:5000** (root)
- Each of the Virtual Agents can be conversed with; Enjoy.

## Testing 

- The Javascript section of the application was tested utilising the Jasmine framework. To see the test logs, navigate to the url **127.0.0.1:5000/jasmineTests** - *Disclaimer - numerous tests are being carried out, thus, the page takes along time to load*.

- The Affectiva APK testing section of the application utilsies User Testing. To test, navigate to the url **127.0.0.1:5000/affectivaTests** - *Results of the testing are displayed within the footer of the page*

- The FLASK Testing section can only be carried out in the **terminal**. Enter the command `pytest`, while in the Affective Virtual Agent directory.
